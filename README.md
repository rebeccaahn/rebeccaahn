### **I'm Rebecca Ahn, a first-year CS student at UC Irvine!**
As I enthusiastically journey into the vast, unknown world of *Computer Science*, I'm constantly learning new things and will continue to explore whenever possible. I'm excited to build and grow projects and products. ðŸŒ³

As Proverbs 18:15 states,  
> The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge, for the ears of the wise seek it out.

Motivated by the pursuit of knowledge and carrying a sense of moral responsibility, I hope that whoever is viewing my profile right now is encouraged to do the same. ðŸ’œ
